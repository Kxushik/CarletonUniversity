1.1	 What is a variable? 
A variable is a way to store and reference data values. Some types of values it can hold is int, float, string, boolean. 



1.2	 What is a boolean expression? Give an example.
A boolean expression is an expression that is evaluated using Truth values 
(5==5)
When evaluated, this comparison is held to be True. Since 5 is equal to 5.

But something like (6==5) when evaluated would be considered false, as 6 is not equal to 5.


1.3	 What does the assignment statement do? Give a small example.
The assignment statement assigns variables with data. The assignment statement in python is '='.

x = 12
The variable 'x' is assigned the int value '12' using the assignment statement '='.


1.4	 Give 3 examples of types of data that we have seen in class so far.

Float
Int
String


1.5	 Why is indentation important in Python? What purpose does it serve?

Indentation in python is important because it helps the flow of the code. Using whitespaces you can help limit what can be run freely and what would require a condition fulfilled in order to be executed. Indentation helps with organizing and limiting your code.
